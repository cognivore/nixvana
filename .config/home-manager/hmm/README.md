# Usage

## Install home-manager with flake support

We assume that you have installed nix with [user-friendly flakes installer](https://github.com/cognivore/icfpc-compute).

It should give you home-manager with flake support. Duh.

## Use this repository instead of `~/.config/home-manager/`

Delete autogenerated `~/.config/home-manager/`.

Tailor this repo to your taste (if you are a [ZeroHR](https://zerohr.io) contractor or employee, you'll at the very least need GPG setup, bash setup and passveil setup).

Run `home-manager switch`.

Enjoy!

Don't forget to fork this repo and push your home-manager configuration into your fork.

# Lsp / VSCode
